# If I bought $GME...

Do you wish you bought [$GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME?p=GME&.tsrc=fin-srch)? You're not the only one. I can't help you go back and time for those gains but I can show you how much you *could have made*.

## Why?

Why not? I was bored and I like making things with code. Sometimes you just do what you love for the heck of it.

## Who Am I?

[I'm an ex-software engineer currently pursuing a computer science degree](https://anthonymorris.dev). I like playing tennis, eating donuts, and making investments based on [/r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/).
